# VRay-Assist-Tools
A collect of small quality of life tools to expedite some steps. Built originally for VRay 2.6

The Scripts folder contains individual Mel commands for specific functions--they were built in a rapid pipeline so most lack annotation. 

The Assign Substance Maps folder contains a batch processing on materials for substance painter maps. It was also built in a rapid setting so it is not polished no robust, but it served me well in a pinch.
